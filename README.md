# 🧑‍💻 Guillermo Vivancos Alonso

Hi there! I'm Guillermo, a tech enthusiast with a background in **Computer Engineering**. My professional journey began in **computing and data analysis**, which helped me build a solid foundation in logic, problem-solving, and working with large datasets.

Through my current role as a **Data Analyst**, I've developed a deep interest in **full stack web development**. In my spare time, I enjoy expanding my programming skills and building web applications to explore the creative and technical aspects of software development.

### 🚀 Ongoing Development

I'm committed to continuous learning and broadening my technical expertise — especially in full stack development. Whether it's frontend frameworks or backend logic, I enjoy diving into new challenges and keeping up with modern web technologies.
