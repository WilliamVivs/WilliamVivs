# 🧑‍💻 Guillermo Vivancos Alonso

Hi there! I'm Guillermo, a tech enthusiast with a background in **Computer Engineering**. I started my career focusing on **computing and data analysis**, but along the way, I discovered that what truly excites me is web developement.

I'm currently working as a **Data Analyst**, which has given me a strong foundation in logic, problem-solving, and working with large datasets. However, I'm actively shifting my career path towards **full stack web development**, learning and building projects to sharpen my skills and make this transition a reality.

### 🚀 Career Goal

My goal is to become a skilled and creative **Full Stack Developer**, capable of building complete web applications from the ground up. I'm working hard every day to improve my frontend and backend development skills and stay up to date with modern best practices.
